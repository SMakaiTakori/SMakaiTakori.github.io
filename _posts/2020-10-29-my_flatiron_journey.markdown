I began Flatiron exactly 10 months ago and despite all of the challenges, I am glad I took that first step towards building my skills. In 2017, I decided I wanted to transition my career into the world of tech. I started teaching myself to code with HTML, CSS, and JS using YouTube, Udemy and freecodecamp. I then started attending community events where I would take classes on these languages and started building SPAs and mini games to help me learn and practice. These meetups were really fun because I got to build simple things to get my feet wet and see if I really enjoyed coding. I was able to land a contract through networking and wanted to add to my skill set.

So, I joined an app called Career Karma which helped me become consistent with practicing code each day and also networking with other people who were thinking about joining bootcamps. It was very motivating and since the app was created by some bootcamp grads, they had already connected their site to a few bootcamps in my area so I was able to apply to three different bootcamps very easily and get the process started. 

After some interviews, I decided to enroll in the Flatiron school because I liked how their curriculum was set up. It also seemed that I would have plenty of support and resources throughout my journey. I enrolled in the part time track and had two lectures a week, along with office hours and one on ones or pod group meetings with my lead instructor. They also told me, I would then be given extensive help in preparation for my job search. It sounded perfect for me so I dove in and never looked back!

I have learned so much from this program. I am now confident in my ability to build a full stack application. I donâ€™t have to restrict myself to only front end frameworks, even though I do still love front end, I am comfortable in my ability to build a backend too, thanks to Flatiron! Thanks to our assessments on our portfolio projects, I am also more comfortable with the idea of doing technical interviews with companies in my search for a Software engineer job. 

Throughout these past ten months I have learned about more than just code. I have had amazing instructors that were there providing lectures, extra resources, help with tech labs, and any guidance needed when it came time to build our own applications. I was fortunate enough to start networking with my cohort mates early on in our program so I have also built an awesome network of friends and colleagues. There were many late nights and early mornings where my main study group of three would meet up to help each other study for assessments, a tough lab, to talk through code in our own apps, or just meet for a morale boost to remind each other that we were in this together.

I have to say that is what helped me get through this program the most, especially once the coronavirus pandemic hit. Amidst all the chaos that was happening in the world, with finances, having to quarantine and STILL having to focus on our code and passing assessments, our small group still persisted and helped each other whenever we could. I am so proud of us for sticking with it and continuing to support each other through all the craziness.

Hands down, the best decision I made in this program was to keep connecting with my group and helping/ asking for help from any other cohort mates that were on slack asking or offering their assistance. I have met some amazing people in this bootcamp and am so glad to say that although we have graduated, I have built a lasting network of friends that went through this amazing experience with me. I get to zoom and slack them anytime now as we all progress in our future endeavors. Each one of us is ready to help, learn, and continue to grow so I know we will all end up doing something amazing with all of this knowledge.
