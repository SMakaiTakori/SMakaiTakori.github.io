I have always loved the challenge of putting things together and solving problems. Whether it’s building a computer from the motherboard up, putting puzzles and legos together, or just figuring out why the router won’t work! Throughout my life, I've also found that I have a passion for teaching and being involved in my tech community. When I discovered programming, honestly, my world opened up. 

I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript through resources I found online. From there, I would purchase different web development courses through Udemy, and watched countless YouTube videos so I could practice building different web applications. I also began attending meetups hosted by various tech groups in my local community. Different coding bootcamps and other groups would put on simple one-hour workshops where they would introduce basic coding skills, as well as help you build a static webpage or a cool JavaScript/Ruby game. I loved being part of the tech community and even had fun participating in a few civic coding hackathons focused on creating websites and apps for startups. I eventually landed my first paid contract using my skills, to build out a company’s website for them!

It was a lot of hard work and I learned so much about myself just from that one job. I wanted to keep going! I started applying to other jobs but quickly realized I was not prepared for the intense coding challenges and technical interviews that came with getting a job at a bigger company. I do admit, it was a discouraging process and for a little while it made me feel like I wasn’t good enough to get a job at these organizations.

I dusted myself off though and really asked myself what I could do to get better. The answer I found was to enroll myself into a coding bootcamp. Not only would I gain the necessary skills I needed to feel more confident in these technical interviews, but I would also have access to more resources and support to help me reach that goal quicker than I could alone. After establishing myself as a software engineering, I will also be better equipped to give back to my community by using these new skills to teach and give others that same support I was seeking.
