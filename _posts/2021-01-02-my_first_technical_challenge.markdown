I am at the beginning of my job search for a software engineer role and am learning so much. For my first technical interview challenge, I was asked to complete three sets of  challenges and had a 6 hour time limit once I started. The first challenge was a javascript algorithm challenge where I was tasked with figuring out how to output the letter that appears twice in a given string. So, if the string was “aardvark” the letter “a” should be outputted to the console. This challenge wasn’t too bad because I have been practicing javascript algorithms and turns out I had practiced a problem similar to this one, so it didn’t take me too long to figure it out and pass all tests.

The next challenge was all about ActiveRecord validations. I have done several projects where I was required to set up user validations so this one was really fun to figure out. There were about 10 different validations I was asked to complete. Each one corresponded to a different attribute of a user and some I didn’t even know existed until this challenge. I was asked to validate things from the presence of the name and email, to validating age as an integer making sure it didn’t return nil, to validating a phone number that had to begin with +1 and could only be followed by 10 digits, this required me to write a regular expression a.k.a Regex to complete this challenge. This challenge took me longer than the JS one but I was able to successfully get the tests to pass and I was on to the final, and longest challenge! 

The final challenge entailed me building a todo list application using React.js library. This was a tough but fun challenge! I had to implement an input and button that would render the user’s todo item on the screen. Additionally, the user had to be able to click an item and that item would then adopt a new css class that was already set up for me. This class would show a line through the selected todo item, indicating that the task was complete. Lastly, there should be a counter that keeps track of total todo items vs the ones still left. I was able to figure out everything except for the last part because I was running out of time! I was able to go back and complete the last part on my own after the challenge was submitted. If you're interested, you can check out my todo app repo at the end of this post. 

I learned a few lessons during this challenge. The main lesson I learned was to give myself more time at the end of the challenge to make sure my code works in their editor! This was a big one, as I didn’t leave myself enough time and couldn’t even get my todo app code to render correctly inside their editor, even though it worked perfectly inside my local environment. I also learned a lot about the many more validations you can perform using ActiveRecord. I was able to put into practice all that I have been learning and am so happy I was able to officially submit my first coding challenge even though it wasn’t 100% correct/done. Overall, it was an excellent challenge and I am happy to have gotten as far as I did. Now, the plan is to keep practicing so I am ready to take on the next one!
